## Executive Summary

A critical issue was identified where the trading system executed an unintended third trade despite only two legitimate trading signals being sent from the third-party execution engine. Analysis reveals this was caused by concurrent webhook processing without proper idempotency protection, combined with a worker crash that created a race condition.

## Issue Timeline

### Normal Trading Sequence
- **14:29:18** - First trade (SELL 2 MNQM5) - Order ID: 223353201862 ‚úÖ
- **14:35:47** - Second trade (BUY 2 MNQM5) - Order ID: 223353201868 ‚úÖ (position closed)

### Problematic Sequence
- **14:49:20** - Server restart (new PID 1597)
- **14:49:57.150** - Webhook request #1 arrives (processed by worker PID 1596)
- **14:49:57.291** - Webhook request #2 arrives (processed by worker PID 1593)
- **14:49:57.xxx** - Worker 1596 gets SIGKILL'd (out of memory)
- **14:49:58.463** - Worker 1593 completes SELL trade (Order ID: 223353201876) ‚ùå **ERRONEOUS**

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Concurrent Webhook Processing Without Idempotency

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
1. **No idempotency protection** - Same webhook payload can trigger multiple trades
2. **No rate limiting enforcement** - Rate limiting code exists but isn't used
3. **No request deduplication** - Identical requests processed independently
4. **Weak concurrency protection** - No safeguards against concurrent identical requests

### Secondary Issue: Faulty Order Creation Flow

**Database Constraint Violations:**
```sql
(psycopg2.errors.NotNullViolation) null value in column "symbol" of relation "orders" violates not-null constraint
```

**Problem Flow:**
1. Strategy service calls `broker.place_order()` without creating Order record first
2. Broker returns order_id and triggers monitoring service
3. Monitoring service creates incomplete placeholder Order with NULL fields
4. Database constraint violation occurs

**Required Fields Missing:**
- `symbol` (NOT NULL constraint)
- `side` (NOT NULL constraint) 
- `order_type` (NOT NULL constraint)
- `quantity` (NOT NULL constraint)

### Infrastructure Issue: Worker Instability

**Evidence:**
```
[2025-06-06 14:49:57 +0000] [1] [ERROR] Worker (pid:1596) was sent SIGKILL! Perhaps out of memory?
```

**Implications:**
- Memory pressure causing worker termination
- Incomplete request processing leading to race conditions
- Potential data inconsistency during crashes

## Technical Analysis

### Webhook Processing Flow (Current - Problematic)

```
Webhook Request ‚Üí Validation (IP, secret, exists) ‚Üí Background Task ‚Üí Strategy Execution ‚Üí Order Placement
     ‚Üì
No duplicate prevention, no idempotency, immediate "accepted" response
```

### Order Creation Flow (Current - Broken)

```
Strategy Service ‚Üí broker.place_order() ‚Üí Broker API ‚Üí order_id returned ‚Üí Monitoring Service ‚Üí Placeholder Order (INCOMPLETE)
```

### Order Creation Flow (Manual Orders - Working)

```
Manual Endpoint ‚Üí Create Complete Order Record ‚Üí broker.place_order() ‚Üí Monitoring Service ‚Üí Update Existing Order
```

## Code Locations & Evidence

### Webhook Handler
**File:** `/app/api/v1/endpoints/webhooks.py`
- **Lines 157-238:** Main webhook endpoint
- **Issue:** No idempotency protection, unused rate limiting

### Strategy Service  
**File:** `/app/services/strategy_service.py`
- **Line 245:** Calls `broker.place_order()` without creating Order record
- **Issue:** Missing database record creation before broker call

### Trading Service
**File:** `/app/services/trading_service.py`  
- **Lines 58-69:** Creates incomplete placeholder orders
- **Issue:** Missing required fields causing constraint violations

### Order Model Schema
**File:** `/app/models/order.py`
- **Lines 41-44:** Required fields: symbol, side, order_type, quantity
- **Issue:** Placeholder creation violates NOT NULL constraints

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact
- **Financial Risk:** Unintended position exposure
- **Trading Strategy Integrity:** Strategy performance affected by erroneous trades
- **Client Trust:** Unexpected trades damage user confidence

### Technical Impact
- **Data Integrity:** Database constraint violations
- **System Reliability:** Worker crashes indicate instability

#### 2.2 Add Transaction Isolation
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** 6-8 hours  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Files modified:**
- `/app/services/strategy_service.py`
- `/app/services/distributed_lock.py` (new)
- `/app/api/v1/endpoints/monitoring.py`

**üéØ Implementation: Per-Account Locking Strategy**

**Problem Analysis:**
Multi-level fan-out pattern creates race conditions:
```
1 Webhook ‚Üí Multiple Strategies (cross-user) ‚Üí Multiple Accounts per Strategy
```
Critical issue: Multiple strategies can target the same broker account simultaneously.

**Solution: Per-Account Resource Locking**
- Lock granularity: `account_lock:{account_id}` (protects broker account resource)
- Scope: All trading operations for a specific account 
- Allows: Parallel execution across different accounts
- Prevents: Race conditions when multiple strategies target same account

**‚úÖ COMPLETED - June 6, 2025**
- ‚úÖ **Implemented Redis-based distributed locking system:**
  - `DistributedLock` class with atomic SET NX EX operations
  - `AccountLockManager` for high-level account locking
  - Context manager pattern for automatic lock cleanup
  - Exponential backoff retry with jitter (1s, 2s, 4s max 3 retries)

- ‚úÖ **Integrated account-level locking in strategy execution:**
  - Modified `_execute_single_account_strategy()` to use distributed locks
  - Added database transaction wrapping with proper rollback
  - Lock held throughout entire order execution process (30-second timeout)
  - Graceful fallback when Redis unavailable (fail-open for availability)

- ‚úÖ **Enhanced position awareness and duplicate prevention:**
  - Added current position checking before trade execution
  - Smart logic to skip SELL signals when no long position exists
  - Allow BUY signals to add to or initiate positions
  - Prevents erroneous trades based on account state

- ‚úÖ **Added comprehensive monitoring and admin tools:**
  - `/api/v1/monitoring/locks/account/{account_id}` - Check lock status
  - `/api/v1/monitoring/locks/status` - System-wide lock monitoring  
  - `/api/v1/monitoring/locks/account/{account_id}/unlock` - Force unlock (admin)
  - Real-time lock contention and timeout tracking

- ‚úÖ **Safety and reliability features:**
  - Lua scripts for atomic check-and-release operations
  - Unique lock values to prevent accidental releases
  - Automatic lock expiration to handle crashed processes
  - Lock extension capability for long-running operations

**Example Flow:**
```
Webhook ABC123 triggers:
‚îú‚îÄ Strategy 1 ‚Üí Account 12345 (acquires lock, executes trade)
‚îú‚îÄ Strategy 2 ‚Üí Account 12345 (waits for lock, sees position, skips)
‚îú‚îÄ Strategy 3 ‚Üí Account 67890 (parallel execution - different account)
‚îî‚îÄ Strategy 4 ‚Üí Account 44444 (parallel execution - different account)
```

**Lock Key Format:** `account_lock:{account_id}`
**Lock Duration:** 30-second timeout with auto-cleanup
**Retry Pattern:** 0.1s, 0.2s, 0.4s + jitter (max 3 retries)
**Fallback Behavior:** Fail-open when Redis unavailable for system availability
